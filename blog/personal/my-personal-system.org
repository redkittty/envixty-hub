* My Personal System
** Operating System
I use Linux as my main Operating System

Yes I know you are gonna say that it is infact "GNU/Linux"

I know it is actually GNU/Linux

The Linux Distro I use is Arch Linux (btw): [[https://redkittty.github.io/img/arch.png]]

|                      FEATURES                     |
|---------------------------------------------------|
|    Rolling Release (get newest software first)    |
| Arch User Repository (Repo of user-made software) |
| Less Bloated (Less Software installed by default) |

If you are new to linux, I would recommend installing a Distro like [[https://linuxmint.org][Linux Mint]] due to their ease-of-use

** Window Manager
I use [[https://awesomewm.org][AwesomeWM]] as my Window Manager

Here is why:
|                                                                              REASONS WHY                                                                            |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Configured in a real language (due to being configured in lua, you can do anything with this wm)                                                                    |
| Tiling (Instead of being floating where windows are ontop of other windows, this is tilied meaning windows are TILED next to other Windows, Improving Productivity) |
| Efficiency (This WM primary uses the keyboard instead of the mouse, Improving Productivity)                                                                         |

Here is a screenshot of my AwesomeWM config:

** Utilities
*** Basic Utils
For my text editor, I have both [[https://neovim.io][Neovim]] and [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]]

Nowadays, I use [[https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs][Doom Emacs]] way more than Neovim

Here is why:

|                          REASONS WHY                           |
|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|          GUI (things like photo previews are possible)         |
| Org-Mode (A comprehensive note-taking and website making tool) |
|    Magit (TUI frontend for Git, easier to use than CLI git)    |
| Doom Config (Makes it easier to manage config by splitting it) |

For my Terminal Emulator, I use [[https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/][Kitty]]

Here is why

|                      REASONS WHY                     |
|------------------------------------------------------|
|      GPU-POWERED (Allows terminal to be faster)      |
| Kittens (Python Programs for interacting with kitty) |

*** Advanced Utils
For my system shell I use Dash

Here are the reasons why

|                 REASONS WHY                 |
|---------------------------------------------|
| Faster (This is due to it only being POSIX) |

Instead of using SUDO I use DOAS, this is because it is less bloated
